doas.zsh
========
Plugin for zsh, that binds double escape to add doas before the command. Works with aliases. 

Installation
------------
oh-my-zsh: 
    $ git clone https://github.com/monesonn/doas.zsh.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:=~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/doas
    Then type doas in .zshrc' plugins section -> plugins ( doas )
    
Usage
-----
It's works for current typed command and previous failed excecuted commands:    
    $ some command
By pressing the [Ecs] twice, you'll have the same command with doas prefixed:
    $ doas some command
